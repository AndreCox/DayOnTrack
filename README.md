# Day On Track ✅

## Inspiration

Having a team that has members in a minority (ADHD) , we wanted to create an app that would be able to keep us on track. We envisioned an app that could sync across multiple devices, and allow a user to enter in different tasks which would be spread across a day. This app would also be able to automatically add breaks into the tasks and alert users through notifications.

Also making sure that the app could be made commercial couldn't hurt as well.

## What it does

Day On Track provides a daily schedule to the user. From here they can add tasks to be completed which have an estimated time. The app will then automatically break these tasks into manageable chunks while adding breaks. The app can be configured any way the user likes using the settings window which includes changing the length of breaks and toggling notifications. These settings are all stored permanently using browser cookies as well as in the users account.

### Features

- Functional Responsive Interface 🖥️📱
- Add Tasks ✅
- User Accounts 👤
- Automatic Time Management ⏰
- Customizable Settings ⚙️
- Cross Platform Cloud Sync ☁️

## How we built it

We used a tech stack that we designed for this competition for fast development 🚀.

### Components

- Firebase 🔥 (Backend, Users, Authentication, Database)
- React 🏗️ (Scaffolding for our app, handles components and state)
- Tailwindcss 🪶 (Lightweight Styling for our app, provides consistent layout and better customizability)
- Material UI 🎨 (Final coat of paint to make everything look nice, Speeds up development due to prebuilt components)

### Work Order

1. First Created Front End 🖥️
2. Added settings that can be used in tasks ⚙️
3. Added ability to create and edit tasks ✅
4. Added Backend and user authentication 🤖

## Challenges we ran into

Not everything went smoothly when building the app, however it was much smoother than we expected. This was probably because we had put in some planning before the competition on the way we would approach the challenge.

The most difficult part was organizing tasks and creating an algorithm that would allow them to be spaced evenly throughout the day no matter the length of the task or how many tasks existed.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎉

We're super happy that we were able to complete so much in such a short amount of time and with only 2 team members. Also we're super proud of the fact that this app may be developed further to get it into the hands of people who could really benefit from it.

## What we learned

This is both our first Hackathon 🐣 so we have learnt so much!
Here are all the software that we used that was new to us.

1. Firebase 🔥
2. Tailwindcss 🪶
3. Material UI 🎨
4. React Cookies 🍪

Not only did we learn new software but we also did a lot of work on creating smart algorithms to organize tasks. We had almost no experience with this at the start.

## What's next for Day On Track

We were super exited how well our app turned out and with a bit more tweaking we think we may be able to add some extra features to make it even more user friendly. After that we want to use Ionic to create an Android and IOS app and hopefully make a commercial product. 🧑‍🚀🚀🌕

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" to your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.

### npm test

Launches the application test runner.
Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.
